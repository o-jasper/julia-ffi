# Julia ffi stuff
Everything that is autogenerated is under `autoffi/`, not everything works
(or is complete there) there.

All the stuff in `autoffi/` is completely analogous to the C interface. Some
extra stuff is added outside of that directory.

### Usage
To use, first compile some stuff within with `make`(though not all of them
need it)

Then edit `~/.juliarc.jl` and add (NOTE: it used to be `/src/julia-src/`)

    push(LOAD_PATH, "$(path_to_parse_c_header)/julia-src/")

Then things can be loaded with paths originating from that.(hopefully)

The following may be advisable at the end of `.juliarc.jl`:
    
    for path in LOAD_PATH
	  size = filesize(path)
      assert( size>0, "Seems like path in LOAD_PATH doesn't exist.
    size $size (using filesize as proxy. TODO find file_exists)")
    end

## Stuff reasonably usable:

### Opengl
I have yet to find any problem with `autoffi/gl.j`, `gl_util.j` adds some 
useful functions, and overloaded version of the C functions
(Note: `glcolor` does *not* use `glcolorb` for integers; it would be
confusing)

It also adds some macros like `@with_primitive` and `@with_pushed_matrix`, i
try follow [cl-opengl](http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-opengl/) when 
reasonable.

I find `frame_to` and `frame_from` confusing and poorly named, so i will 
probably rename them at some point.

### SDL
`bad_sdl_utils` need `make` to be run from it's directory.

Note that this currently does not at all use the autoffi stuff.

### The rest.
`autoffi/glu.j` not at all tested yet, `autoffi/acpi.j` lacks a function to 
create the structs and look at its items. I want to add autogenerators for 
those. Note that then those parts aren't analogous to the C interface, and 
also maybe Julia will/has already increased support for FFIing those..
